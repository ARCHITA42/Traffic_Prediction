Traffic Density Prediction ðŸ›£ using Machine Learning Classifiers
The Traffic Density Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting traffic density in a given area using three different classifiers: KNeighborsClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and DecisionTreeClassifier. By leveraging historical traffic data and various features such as time, weather conditions, and road infrastructure, this project aims to provide accurate predictions for traffic density, enabling better traffic management and planning.

The project utilizes the power of machine learning algorithms to learn patterns and relationships between the input features and traffic density. 
The three classifiers employedâ€”KNeighborsClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, and DecisionTreeClassifier offer different approaches to tackle the prediction task, allowing for a comprehensive analysis and comparison of their performance.
